Weather affects mining, hauling, and shipping differently.

MINING:
- Rain > 20 mm → high risk, production drop
- Cloud cover > 70% → moderate impact
- Temperature extremes reduce efficiency slightly

HAULING:
- Rain increases road slipperiness → cycle delay
- Wind minimal effect unless extreme

SHIPPING:
- Wind > 35 km/h → stop loading
- Rain > 10 mm → reduce loading rate by 20–40%
- Cloudy weather minor impact

Weather Impact Levels:
- MINIMAL
- MODERATE
- SIGNIFICANT
