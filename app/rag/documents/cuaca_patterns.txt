WEATHER PATTERNS AND OPERATIONAL IMPACT — DUMMY GUIDELINES

PRECIPITATION:
- 0–5 mm: Light rain. Minimal operational impact. Suitable for aggressive plans.
- 5–20 mm: Moderate rain. Moderate operational constraints. Balanced plan recommended.
- >20 mm: Heavy rain. High operational constraints. Avoid aggressive plans.

WIND SPEED:
- 0–15 km/h: Safe. Normal operational window.
- 15–30 km/h: Potential slowdown in loading & hauling. Avoid high-risk scheduling.
- >30 km/h: High wind risk. Shipping may be delayed. Mining excavation slowdown.

TEMPERATURE:
- 24–32°C optimal for equipment efficiency.
- >35°C may cause overheating and reduce efficiency_factor.
- <18°C may reduce cycle stability.

CLOUD COVER:
- <40%: Normal visibility, stable operations.
- 40–70%: Minor impact, no major risk.
- >70%: Potentially reduced light. Small reduction in production efficiency.

KEY RULES:
- Aggressive plans require: precipitation <10, wind_speed <20, visibility normal.
- Balanced plans require: precipitation <20, wind_speed <30.
- Conservative plans recommended if precipitation >20 or wind_speed >30.
