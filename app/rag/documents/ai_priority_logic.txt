AI Priority Score is predicted using:
- Planned Production
- Hauling Distance
- Human Priority Score
- Weather factors

Scores:
- High     → 2
- Medium   → 1
- Low      → 0

Rules:
1. High human priority usually remains high unless weather severely degrades.
2. Long distance + bad weather → downgrade priority.
3. High rainfall in pit area → reduce priority.
4. Efficiency < 0.7 → downgrade priority.

AI Priority assists in sequencing pit operations and resource allocation.
