FINANCIAL IMPACT RULES — DUMMY GUIDELINES

COST STRUCTURE:
- Total cost driven by hauling_distance_km, cycle_delay_min, and weather delays.
- Every +1 km of hauling distance adds incremental operational cost.
- Rain >20 mm increases cost by introducing delay and idle-time cost.

FINANCIAL IMPACT CLASSIFICATION:
- High savings: >15% reduction from baseline_total_cost_usd.
- Moderate savings: 8–15% reduction.
- Low savings: <8% reduction.

RISK VS COST TRADEOFF RULES:
- Aggressive strategy permitted only if risk_level = LOW or MEDIUM AND savings >10%.
- Balanced strategy is default unless weather_impact severe.
- Conservative strategy preferred when predicted_demurrage_cost or operational delay risk exceeds thresholds.

OPTIMIZATION CONSTRAINTS:
- Conservative plans minimize risk, acceptable if savings small.
- Balanced plans provide stable compromise between risk + savings.
- Aggressive plans aim to maximize cost_savings_usd while accepting higher cycle_delay_min variability.

KEY RULE:
“Choose the plan with the highest savings that stays within acceptable risk for weather_impact and equipment efficiency.”
