Hauling connects PIT → ROM → Jetty.

Key parameters:
- Hauling distance (km)
- Volume hauled (tons)
- Number of trucks required
- Fuel cost
- Travel time (distance / avg speed)
- ROM and jetty assignments

Rules:
1. Longer distance → higher cycle delay.
2. Wet conditions increase haul duration.
3. Fuel cost = distance * volume * fuel_rate_per_km.
4. Jetty congestion increases queue time.
5. Mismatch between hauling and shipping creates bottlenecks.

Daily summary fields include:
- active ROMs
- trucks required
- hauling distance
- fuel cost
- jetty demand

Hauling Planner focus:
- Ensure ROM stock meets vessel loading needs.
- Reduce fuel cost.
- Reduce congestion at ROMs and jetties.
