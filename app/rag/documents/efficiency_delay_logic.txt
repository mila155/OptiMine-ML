Efficiency Factor prediction considers:
- Planned production vs predicted
- Weather
- Hauling distance
- Cycle delay variation

Typical efficiency range: 0.65–0.92

Cycle Delay increases when:
- Hauling distance is long
- Multiple pits share same ROM
- Bad weather
- Hauler shortage
- Queueing events

Delay categories:
- Normal: 1–2 min
- Moderate: 2–3.5 min
- High: > 3.5 min
