Shipping controls vessel loading at each jetty.

Factors:
- Planned volume (tons)
- Loading rate (tons/hour)
- Weather (wind, rain, cloud cover)
- Vessel ETA/ETD
- ROM supply
- Jetty capacity
- Demurrage risk

Rules:
1. Wind speed > 35 km/h increases loading delay.
2. Rain > 10 mm reduces loading efficiency.
3. Loading Hours = planned_volume / loading_rate.
4. Demurrage Cost increases when loading takes longer than ETA+buffer.
5. Nearest jetty recommendation uses ROM → Jetty distance.

Shipping Planner cares about:
- Vessel scheduling
- Jetty utilization
- Queueing risks
- Weather risks impacting loading
- Minimizing demurrage
