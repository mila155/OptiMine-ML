EQUIPMENT FACTORS FOR MINING OPERATIONS — DUMMY GUIDELINES

EXCAVATOR PERFORMANCE:
- Standard cycle time: 25–32 seconds.
- Wet conditions increase cycle delay by 5–15%.
- Efficiency degradation under moderate rain: -0.05 to -0.10.

HAUL TRUCK PERFORMANCE:
- Optimal hauling distance: <10 km.
- For distances 10–20 km: fuel cost and cycle delay increase significantly.
- Hauling_distance_km directly increases cycle_delay_min.

EQUIPMENT FAILURE PROBABILITY (DUMMY):
- High rainfall: +10% risk.
- Wind_speed >30 km/h: +5% operational disruption.

EFFICIENCY FACTOR GUIDELINE:
- Efficiency >0.85: suitable for aggressive or balanced.
- 0.70–0.85: balanced recommended.
- <0.70: conservative required.

KEY RULES:
- Aggressive plans require low hauling distance and high observed efficiency.
- Balanced plans tolerate mid hauling distance and moderate cycle delays.
- Conservative plans required when weather + equipment risk both elevated.
