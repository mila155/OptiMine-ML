Mining production is influenced by:
- Planned Production (ton/day)
- Hauling Distance (km)
- AI adjusted production (model output)
- Efficiency factor (0–1)
- Cycle delay (minutes)
- Weather factors: precipitation, wind, cloud cover, temperature
- Priority score (human + AI)
- Equipment availability and operational efficiency
- Pit configuration and geology

General rules:
1. Efficiency typically ranges 0.65 – 0.92.
2. High rainfall (> 20 mm/day) significantly reduces production.
3. Wind < 30 km/h has minimal impact on mining operations.
4. AI Priority Score:
   - 2 = High
   - 1 = Medium
   - 0 = Low
5. High-priority pits should be sequenced earlier in the day.
6. Cycle delay increases when:
   - Hauling distance is long
   - Weather is poor
   - Traffic congestion increases (multiple pits hauling to same ROM)

Risk levels:
- HIGH    → Efficiency < 0.70 or rain > 20 mm
- MEDIUM  → Efficiency 0.70–0.85 or rain 10–20 mm
- LOW     → Efficiency > 0.85 and rain < 10 mm

Mining Planner cares about:
- Production gap
- Pit scheduling
- Efficiency predictions
- Weather impact on mining performance
